****vLLM model loading****
**Why vLLM?**

vLLM  is one of several popular, open-source inference and serving engines specifically designed to optimize the performance of generative AI applications through more efficient GPU memory utilization.

**Key Benefits of vLLM**
**Superior Performance**

Up to 24x higher throughput compared to standard PyTorch implementations
Continuous batching for optimal GPU utilization
Optimized CUDA kernels for faster inference speeds
Efficient Memory Management with PagedAttention

Reduces GPU memory usage by up to 60%
Dynamic memory allocation for KV cache
Enables larger batch sizes and longer sequences
Production-Ready Architecture

OpenAI-compatible API server for easy integration
Distributed inference with tensor parallelism
Built-in streaming responses and request scheduling
While vLLM is not mandatory for running generative AI applications, these advantages make it a compelling choice for production deployments. Alternative inference engines like TensorRT-LLM can also be used for running generative AI models. Although this workshop implements vLLM, the concepts and techniques covered are applicable to other inference engines as well.

For detailed performance benchmarks and technical insights, you can refer to vLLM's latest performance update .

In the next section, we'll demonstrate how to deploy a Mistral-based LLM using vLLM on an Amazon EKS cluster.
