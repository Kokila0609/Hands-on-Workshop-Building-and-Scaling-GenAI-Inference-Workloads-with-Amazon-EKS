Inference on Amazon EKS
This section demonstrates how to deploy and scale Large Language Model (LLM) inference workloads on Amazon EKS using NVIDIA GPUs. You'll learn to implement inference solutions with modern optimization frameworks and comprehensive observability.

What You'll Learn
Throughout this module, you will:

Configure NVIDIA GPU support for LLM inference workloads
Deploy models using vLLM for optimized performance and memory utilization
Scale inference workloads using Ray Serve for distributed computing
Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability for GPU and LLM metrics
Architecture Overview
By the end of this section, you'll have deployed a complete LLM inference solution featuring:

GPU-optimized EKS cluster with NVIDIA device plugin support
Mistral-7B model served via vLLM for optimal performance
Ray Serve orchestration for scalable distributed inference
Comprehensive monitoring for GPU and application metrics
Let's begin by configuring GPU support for your EKS cluster.
